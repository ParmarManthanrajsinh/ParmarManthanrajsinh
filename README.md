<pre>
Ideas by man and only that will last
And over time, we've learned from the past
That no man's fit to rule the world alone
A man will die, but not his ideas
Happy nation, livin' in a happy nation
Where the people understand and dream of perfect man
Situation leading to sweet salvation
For the people, for the good, for mankind brotherhood
